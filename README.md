## About ðŸ˜µ

I originally created this PokÃ©dex in my junior year of high school as a small, one-day project.
At the time, the national PokÃ©dex was in generation 7, the Alola region.
This cross-referencing ability was useful for teambuilding and breeding purposes.

## Todo ðŸ”®

* [ ] Add data for generation 8.
* [ ] Add different sections for each generation standalone.
* [ ] Update/Read querystring to share/load a cross-reference instantaneously.
