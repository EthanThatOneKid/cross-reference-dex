# Cross-Reference Dex ðŸ¤ž
> A PokÃ©dex that allows for cross-reference searching by move, ability, and type.

## About ðŸ˜µ
I originally created this PokÃ©dex in my junior year of high school as a small, one-day project.
At the time, the national PokÃ©dex was in generation 7, the Alola region.
This cross-referencing ability was useful for teambuilding and breeding purposes.

## Todo ðŸ”®
* [ ] Distinguish between generation 7 and generation 8 for relevancy.
